# To-Do-List<br/>
Our project is a full-stack to-do list application that offers a comprehensive range of features to manage everyday tasks efficiently. Developed using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, our application provides a seamless user experience. Users can easily add, mark, edit, update, and remove tasks, with the lists arranged in descending order based on the date. Additionally, tasks can be categorized as active or done, allowing for better organization and tracking. Furthermore, we have implemented a dark mode using Tailwind CSS, enhancing the visual aesthetics of the application. The combination of these technologies and features makes our to-do list application a powerful and valuable tool for personal and professional task management.
